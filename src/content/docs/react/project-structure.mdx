# React Project Structure & Best Practices

A well-structured React project improves maintainability, scalability, and developer experience. This guide covers best practices for structuring React projects, including folder organization, naming conventions, and import aliasing.

## 📁 Standard React Project Structure

A typical React project can be organized as follows:

```plaintext
/src
  ├── components/    # Reusable UI components
  ├── hooks/         # Custom hooks
  ├── contexts/      # React Context API providers
  ├── services/      # API calls, utilities, external services
  ├── pages/         # Page-level components (e.g., Home, Dashboard)
  ├── assets/        # Static files like images and styles
  ├── routes/        # Route definitions (optional)
  ├── styles/        # Global styles (CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, etc.)
  ├── utils/         # Utility functions/helpers
  ├── constants/     # Store reusable configurations (e.g., navbar arrays)
  ├── App.js         # Main application component
  ├── main.js        # React entry point (Vite projects use this instead of index.js)
```

## 📌 Feature-Based vs. Layer-Based Structuring

### **Feature-Based Structure**

This approach groups files by feature, making it easier to manage and scale larger applications. Each feature has its own components, hooks, services, and state management files.

```plaintext
/src
  ├── features/
  │   ├── auth/
  │   │   ├── components/
  │   │   ├── hooks/
  │   │   ├── services/
  │   │   ├── AuthPage.js
  │   │   ├── authContext.js
  │   │   ├── authReducer.js
```

✅ **Best for:** Large, modular applications with multiple independent features that need encapsulation and scalability.

### **Layer-Based Structure**

This structure separates files based on their function (UI, logic, API, etc.), keeping related concerns together.

```plaintext
/src
  ├── components/
  ├── hooks/
  ├── services/
  ├── pages/
```

✅ **Best for:** Small to mid-sized applications where concerns remain well-separated without needing deep feature isolation.

### **When to Choose Each Structure?**

- Use **feature-based** if your app is growing and has distinct modules like authentication, dashboard, and user management.
- Use **layer-based** if your app is small or medium-sized, and you prefer a simple and clear structure.
- A hybrid approach can also be used, where core utilities (e.g., `utils/`, `services/`) stay in layers, while features follow a feature-based pattern.

## 📄 File Naming Conventions

- **Small projects**: Keep component files inside `/components`.
- **Larger projects**: Use component folders with an `index.js` entry point.
- **Component files**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `NavBar.js`, `UserCard.js`).
- **Hooks & utility files**: Use camelCase (e.g., `useAuth.js`, `fetchData.js`).
- **Context providers**: Use meaningful names (e.g., `AuthContext.js`).

## 🚀 Import Aliases

Import aliases help simplify imports and avoid long relative paths.

### **Example Configuration (Vite & Webpack)**

#### `vite.config.js`

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@components': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/components'),
      '@hooks': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/hooks'),
      '@services': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/services'),
      '@constants': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/constants'),
    },
  },
});
```

#### `webpack.config.js`

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@components': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/components'),
      '@hooks': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/hooks'),
      '@services': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/services'),
      '@constants': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/constants'),
    },
  },
};
```

### **Usage in Code**

Instead of:

```js
import Button from '../../components/Button';
```

Use:

```js
import Button from '@components/Button';
```

## ✅ Summary & Best Practices Checklist

✔ Use a clear folder structure that fits your project size and complexity.\
✔ Organize files using either feature-based or layer-based structuring.\
✔ Follow consistent file naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for hooks).\
✔ Use import aliases to simplify module resolution and improve readability.
