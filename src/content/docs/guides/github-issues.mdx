## GitHub Issues Workflow
The following guide explains how GitHub Issues are used to create, track, and manage tasks and assignments effectively. While these steps provide a general workflow, adjustments may be necessary based on the project's needs.

### Creating an Issue
- A GitHub issue for the task is created based on issues templates (template for each task type e.g frontend task, backend task).
- Use clear and concise titles that summarize the task (e.g., "Implement user authentication system").
- Provide a detailed description of the task, in the form of a checklist, which includes:
  - The task details (i.e what to do).
  - Instruction to respect / ensure while doing the task (e.g for frontend, verify the text for spelling mistakes).

### Assigning Issues
- Assign the issue to the team member(s) responsible for completing it.

### Tracking Progress
- Using the previously created checklists in the issue description, mark the task completed.

### Closing an Issue
- Once the task is completed and verified, the manager closes the issue.

### Adding Further Issues
- As the project is progessing and new tasks are created, new GitHub issues are also created for those tasks.

### GitHub Issues Templates
<Code code={frontendGitHubIssueTemplate} lang="md" title="frontend-task-template.md"/>

<Code code={backendGitHubIssueTemplate} lang="md" title="backend-task-template.md"/>
