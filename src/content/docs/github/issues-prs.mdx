## Quick Workflow

### For Issues:
1. Create issue using template
2. Assign to someone
3. Add labels
4. Work on it
5. Close when done

### For PRs:
1. Create branch: `yourname/feature/issue-description`
2. Make changes
3. Push and create PR using template
4. Get review
5. Merge when approved

<Aside type="tip">
  **Pro Tip**: Always link your PR to an issue using "Closes #123" so the issue automatically closes when the PR is merged.

That's it! Keep it simple and focus on getting work done. ðŸš€
