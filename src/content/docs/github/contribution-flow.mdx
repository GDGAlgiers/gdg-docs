Simple and practical branching strategy that matches how we actually work in projects.

## Branch Naming Convention

Follow this pattern: `yourname/type/feature-description`

### Examples:
```bash
# Feature branches
john/feature/user-authentication
sarah/feature/payment-integration

# Bug fixes  
mike/fix/login-error
alice/fix/header-styling

# Refactoring
bob/refactor/api-client
mary/refactor/user-service

# Other types
alex/docs/setup-guide
lisa/chore/update-dependencies
```

## Basic Workflow

### 1. Create and Switch to Branch
```bash
# Create new branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b yourname/feature/user-dashboard
```

### 2. Work on Your Feature
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add user dashboard component"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin yourname/feature/user-dashboard
```

### 3. Create Pull Request
- Go to GitHub
- Click "Compare & pull request"
- Use the PR template
- Link to related issue: `Closes #123`
- Request review

### 4. After PR is Merged
```bash
# Switch back to main and clean up
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d yourname/feature/user-dashboard
```

## Working with Issues

### Issue to Branch Flow:
1. **Pick an issue** from the project
2. **Assign yourself** to the issue
3. **Create branch** using issue description
4. **Work on the feature**
5. **Create PR** that closes the issue

### Example:
- Issue #45: "Add dark mode toggle"
- Branch: `yourname/feature/dark-mode-toggle`
- PR title: "Add dark mode toggle (Closes #45)"

## Collaboration Tips

### Before Starting Work:
```bash
# Always start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b yourname/feature/new-feature
```

### Keep Branch Updated:
```bash
# If main has new changes while you work
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout yourname/feature/new-feature
git merge main
```

### Small, Focused Changes:
- One feature per branch
- Keep PRs small and reviewable
- Don't mix different types of changes

## Common Scenarios

### Working on Same Feature:
If multiple people work on one big feature:
- Create feature branch: `feature/payment-system`
- Everyone branches from it: `john/feature/payment-ui`, `sarah/feature/payment-api`
- Merge individual branches to feature branch
- Merge feature branch to main when complete

### Hotfix:
For urgent production fixes:
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b yourname/hotfix/critical-security-fix

# After fix, create PR to main immediately
```

## Review Process

### For PR Authors:
- Use descriptive PR titles
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Link related issues
- Respond to review feedback quickly

### For Reviewers:
- Check that code works
- Verify it follows project guidelines
- Test the changes if possible
- Be constructive in feedback

<Aside type="tip">
  **Pro Tip**: Use draft PRs for work-in-progress to get early feedback, then mark as "Ready for review" when complete.
