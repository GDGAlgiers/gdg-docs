Simple and practical branching strategy that matches how we actually work in projects.

## Branch Naming Convention

Follow this pattern: `yourname/type/feature-description`

### Examples:
```bash
# Feature branches
john/feature/user-authentication
sarah/feature/payment-integration

# Bug fixes  
mike/fix/login-error
alice/fix/header-styling

# Refactoring
bob/refactor/api-client
mary/refactor/user-service

# Other types
alex/docs/setup-guide
lisa/chore/update-dependencies
```

## Basic Workflow

### 1. Create and Switch to Branch
```bash
# Create new branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b yourname/feature/user-dashboard
```

### 2. Work on Your Feature
```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add user dashboard component"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin yourname/feature/user-dashboard
```

### 3. Create Pull Request
- Go to GitHub
- Click "Compare & pull request"
- Use the PR template
- Link to related issue: `Closes #123`
- Request review

### 4. After PR is Merged
```bash
# Switch back to main and clean up
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d yourname/feature/user-dashboard
```

## Working with Issues

### Issue to Branch Flow:
1. **Pick an issue** from the project
2. **Assign yourself** to the issue
3. **Create branch** using issue description
4. **Work on the feature**
5. **Create PR** that closes the issue

### Example:
- Issue #45: "Add dark mode toggle"
- Branch: `yourname/feature/dark-mode-toggle`
- PR title: "Add dark mode toggle (Closes #45)"

## Collaboration Tips

### Before Starting Work:
```bash
# Always start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b yourname/feature/new-feature
```

### Keep Branch Updated:
```bash
# If main has new changes while you work
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout yourname/feature/new-feature
git merge main
```

### Small, Focused Changes:
- One feature per branch
- Keep PRs small and reviewable
- Don't mix different types of changes

## Conflict Resolution & Avoidance

### Preventing Conflicts

**Best practices to avoid conflicts:**
- Pull from main frequently (at least daily)
- Keep branches short-lived (merge within 2-3 days)
- Communicate with team about file changes
- Use clear commit messages

```bash
# Daily routine to avoid conflicts
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout yourname/feature/current-work
git merge main  # or git rebase main for cleaner history
```

### When Conflicts Happen

**Step-by-step conflict resolution:**

1. **Fetch latest changes:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout yourname/feature/conflicted-branch
git merge main
```

2. **Git will show conflict markers:**
```javascript
// Example conflict in a file
<<<<<<< HEAD
const apiUrl = 'https://api.staging.example.com';
=======
const apiUrl = 'https://api.production.example.com';
>>>>>>> main
```

3. **Resolve conflicts manually:**
```javascript
// Choose the correct version or combine both
const apiUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? 'https://api.production.example.com'
  : 'https://api.staging.example.com';
```

4. **Complete the merge:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in api configuration"
git push origin yourname/feature/conflicted-branch
```

### Common Conflict Scenarios

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Package.json">
  ```bash
  # When multiple people add dependencies
  # Always accept both changes and remove duplicates manually
  git checkout --theirs package.json
  npm install  # or yarn install
  git add package.json package-lock.json
  ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Same File Edit">
  ```bash
  # When editing same lines in a file
  # 1. Look at both changes
  # 2. Decide which is correct or combine them
  # 3. Remove conflict markers (<<<, ===, >>>)
  # 4. Test the changes work
  ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="File Rename/Move">
  ```bash
  # When file is renamed/moved in different branches
  # 1. Choose the correct location
  # 2. Make sure imports are updated
  # 3. Delete the duplicate file if exists
  git add .
  git rm old-file-name.js  # if needed
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### If You're Stuck

**When conflicts seem overwhelming:**

1. **Reset and try again:**
```bash
git merge --abort  # Cancel the merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Start over with fresh approach
```

2. **Ask for help:**
- Share your screen with a teammate
- Use GitHub's conflict resolution interface
- Create a new branch and cherry-pick specific commits

3. **Use VS Code merge tools:**
- Install Git Graph extension
- Use built-in merge conflict resolver
- Visual diff makes conflicts easier to understand

<Aside type="caution">
  **Important**: Always test your code after resolving conflicts. Conflicts can break functionality even when Git thinks they're resolved correctly.

## Common Scenarios

### Working on Same Feature:
If multiple people work on one big feature:
- Create feature branch: `feature/payment-system`
- Everyone branches from it: `john/feature/payment-ui`, `sarah/feature/payment-api`
- Merge individual branches to feature branch
- Merge feature branch to main when complete

### Hotfix:
For urgent production fixes:
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b yourname/hotfix/critical-security-fix

# After fix, create PR to main immediately
```

## Review Process

### For PR Authors:
- Use descriptive PR titles
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Link related issues
- Respond to review feedback quickly

### For Reviewers:
- Check that code works
- Verify it follows project guidelines
- Test the changes if possible
- Be constructive in feedback

<Aside type="tip">
  **Pro Tip**: Use draft PRs for work-in-progress to get early feedback, then mark as "Ready for review" when complete.
