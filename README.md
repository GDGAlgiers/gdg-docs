## Project Overview

GDG Docs is an initiative by GDG Algiers aimed at providing high-quality documentation to help members in their development journey. It serves as a structured knowledge base covering best practices, common pitfalls, and essential workflows for the tools and frameworks we frequently use.

## Goal

The primary goal of GDG Docs is to fill the existing documentation with valuable content that helps GDG Algiers members in their development journey. The documentation serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for best practices, common mistakes to avoid, and workflow tools that we frequently use in our projects.

## Key Focus Areas

We're focusing on documenting the tools and frameworks commonly used in our projects:

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, NextJS
- **Backend**: Express JS, Nest JS
- **Mobile Development**: Flutter
- **Development Workflow**: GitHub Projects, GitHub Issues, GitHub Pull Requests

## Content Scope

Our documentation primarily covers:

- **Best Practices**: How to use each tool efficiently
- **Common Mistakes & Pitfalls**: Issues developers frequently encounter and how to avoid them
- **Development Workflow**: A guide on using GitHub Projects, managing issues, and reviewing pull requests
- **Contributions from Members**: Members are encouraged to suggest topics and contribute content they find useful
